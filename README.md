# 📊 Diabetes Prediction — Data1030 Final Project

This repository contains the full code, analysis, and results for the **Diabetes Prediction Project**, completed as the final deliverable for *DATA 1030: Hands-On Data Science*.  
The goal of the project is to build an interpretable machine learning pipeline for predicting diabetes using clinical and demographic features. The workflow includes preprocessing, handling class imbalance, cross-validation, hyperparameter tuning, and model interpretability analysis.

## 🧠 Project Overview

This project follows an end-to-end machine learning process:

- **EDA:** Distribution analysis, missingness patterns, class imbalance.
- **Preprocessing:**  
  - Iterative imputation for BMI  
  - StandardScaler for numeric variables  
  - One-hot encoding for categorical variables  
  - Optional SMOTE oversampling applied only within cross-validation folds
- **Splitting:** Stratified **60/20/20** train/validation/test split  
- **Models Evaluated:** Logistic Regression, SVM, Random Forest, XGBoost  
- **Evaluation Metric:** Primary — **F1 score**; Secondary — precision, recall, accuracy  
- **Interpretability:** Permutation feature importance, XGBoost gain/cover, SHAP force plots
